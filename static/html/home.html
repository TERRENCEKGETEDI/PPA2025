            <h2>What is java?</h2>
            <p>
    Java (also known as Java programming language) was developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 for their middleware
    class project on the Oracle Corporation's infrastructure services and applications software company named
    AspectSoftware, then also used Byteman. It provides support to object-oriented computer systems without requiring
    a virtual machine or garbage collection mechanism as it is one of its core features (and in fact all Java programs
    run within an interpreter/bytecode system).
            <br><br>
    It's primarily designed for writing robust and scalable enterprise software, but also offers more flexibility on
    mobile platforms by enabling multiple threading. It was originally developed with a focus to enhance the
    productivity of programmers working mainly without source-level parallelism (i.e., Java tasks), focusing mostly
    upon object manipulation in languages like C++ or scala - and it's one such language that is now used widely for
    building applications on both mobile platforms as well desktop, due its simplicity yet vast power to the developer
    with multithreading support which makes developing apps fast & efficient.

            <h2>What is java capable of?</h2>
            <p>
    Java can be very versatile and powerful in various ways depending upon what it's used for such applications
    include web development (serving static resources on servers), command-line tools, mobile application building
    with Android Studio or JavaFX UI design using Eclipse IDE.
                <br><br>
    <h3>Here are a few examples of things that could use java:</h3>
    <br><br>
    1. <b>Web Applications</b> - Building complex interactive and dynamic user interfaces is often easier done in web
    languages like JavaScript (with frameworks such as React, Vue). In addition to HTML/CSS for the frontend, Java
    servlets can be used to handle back-ends involving databases or business logic of your application which could
    also benefit from technologies like AJAX.
    <br><br>
    2. <b>Android Application</b> - Java for Android development involves writing in Kotlin or JAVA as both are just two
    ways to write the same code and have equivalent functionality but with different syntactical sugar (Kotiln is more
    concise, easier debugging etc.)  The app can interact directly from a java file via AIDL/Binder.
    <br><br>
    3. <b>Command Line Tools</b> - Writing command line utilities is a common use case for java but also includes
    developing GUI tools like Swing/AWT or JavaFX desktop applications which are quite different from web apps in
    terms of user interface design and interactivity (JavaScript's SVG, Canvas etc.)
    <br><br>
    4. <b>Games/Simulations</b> - If you want to build games or simulations which require physics calculations and other
    complex mathematical computations, then Java can be used effectively with tools like Apache Commons Math for basic
    operations in mathematics but also third-party libraries available as well (like Forger's Simpleton).
    <br><br>
    5. <b>Data Analysis/Machine Learning</b> - Java is often used in data science and machine learning as it has robust
    libraries (like TensorFlow, PyTorch etc) for both tasks with more features compared to Python or R like languages
    that are easy-to learn but powerful enough at executing complex calculations on large datasets directly.

To execute Java programs from command line you can use the `javac` compiler which is a part of JDK (Java
Development Kit), an open-source software development platform that includes a collection of tools used for
writing, compiling and running applications.
<br><br>
<b>Here's how to compile your java file:</b>
<br><br>
<u><b>javac HelloWorld.java</b></u> Replace <b>'HelloWorld.java'</b> with the name of your Java source code (.java) files you
want compiled into classes (with .class extension). The output will be in a directory called "bin" or some
equivalent, depending on how jar is being used to package up sources and resources for distribution as well
<br><br>
<b>After compiling, you can run it by executing a Java class using `java`</b>
<br><br>
<u><b>java HelloWorld</b></u> This will run the class named <b>"Hello World"</b> that is part of jar file. Replace with your
source filename and it must end in '.java'.
